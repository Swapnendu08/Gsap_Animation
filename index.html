            <p class="para">The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) is an American spacecraft
                manufacturer, launcher, and satellite communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. The
                company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and to
                colonize Mars. The company manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Starship heavy-lift launch
                vehicles, the Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon spacecrafts, the Starlink mega-constellation satellite and
                rocket engines.</p> <br>
            <p class="para">SpaceX offers commercial satellite-based internet service via its constellation of Starlink
                satellites, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and as of June 2023
                comprised more than 4,300 small satellites in orbit. </p> <br>
            <p class="para">The company is also developing Starship, a fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system
                for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its failed first flight in April 2023, it became the
                largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. Starship is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital
                vehicle, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. </p> <br>
            <p class="para">SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached
                orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space
                Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of
                any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse
                such a booster. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and reflown more than 170 times.</p>
